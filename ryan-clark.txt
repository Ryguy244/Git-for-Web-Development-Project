    Fork+collaboration+clone+cd to directory where you want your file + git clone "link" + cd into new file + git checkout -b 'firstname-lastname' (creates a branch) + git add . // git commit -m "comment" // git push -u origin branch-name (do this every 30 min or for big changes) +  go back to forked project and click Branch:master + select your branch and click new pull request. This should bring you to a new page where you DO NOT CLICK "CREATE PULL REQUEST" until completing the next step.

    The next step = click dropdown that says "base repository" and change it to your forked repo. Then add TL to "Reviewers" and submit. DO NOT MERGE YOUR OWN PULL REQUEST! (TL will do it)

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    In-line elements operate on a normal page line. Block elements can make their own lines (like images often do)
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    It is positioned relative to the nearest non-static element.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    div, section, and body are display blocks by default. Span and img are inline by default. I think ul is inline block.
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    I found an answer to this. But I won't even pretend it wasn't purely Google. This still confuses me greatly.
